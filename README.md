# Project Portfolio Analysis

## Description
In this project, we take multiple portfolios (a collection of financial investments), compare each to the S&P 500, and calculate which portfolio would be the most profitable long-term.  We obtain the data for each portfolio using API's, specifically Alpaca and Y finance. After cleaning data, we visualize data using HVplot to help the reader understand data with ease.  Long-term profitability is calculated using a Monte-Carlo Simulation.  Monte Carlo Simulations are a broad class of computational algorithms that depend on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
